# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brian Drelling.

I make apps, games, and music. The trick is never sleeping.

You'll typically find me working on all sorts of Swift projects across Apple platforms and Linux, including server-side and command-line applications. I just can't get enough Swift!

Feel free to take a look at my [Manager README](https://github.com/bdrelling/manager_readme)if you'd like to get an idea of what it's like to work with me.
