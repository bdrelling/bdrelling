# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brian Drelling (he/him).

I work at [Medly](https://medly.com/) as the Software Development Manager for the Mobile team. Feel free to take a look at my [Manager README](https://github.com/bdrelling/manager_readme) if you'd like to get an idea of what it's like to work with and/or report to me.

You'll typically find me working on Swift projects spanning across Apple platforms as well as both server-side and command-line development. I simply can't get enough Swift!
