# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Brian Drelling.

I make apps, games, and music. The trick is never sleeping.

You'll typically find me working on all sorts of Swift projects across Apple platforms and Linux, including server-side and command-line applications. I just can't get enough Swift!

Feel free to take a look at my [Manager README](https://github.com/bdrelling/manager_readme) if you'd like to get an idea of what it's like to work with me.

Most of what I work on in the open source space is intended for education and discovery, not monetization. As such, if the work I've done has helped or supported you in any way, please consider becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bdrelling), which will allow me to spend more time on these projects and cover out-of-pocket development costs. Your support means a lot!
